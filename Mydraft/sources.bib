abstract = {This paper describes the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) stereo method. It uses a pixelwise, Mutual Information based matching cost for compensating radiometric differences of input images. Pixelwise matching is supported by a smoothness constraint that is usually expressed as a global cost function. SGM performs a fast approximation by pathwise optimizations from all directions. The discussion also addresses occlusion detection, subpixel refinement and multi-baseline matching. Additionally, postprocessing steps for removing outliers, recovering from specific problems of structured environments and the interpolation of gaps are presented. Finally, strategies for processing almost arbitrarily large images and fusion of disparity images using orthographic projection are proposed.A comparison on standard stereo images shows that SGM is among the currently top-ranked algorithms and is best, if subpixel accuracy is considered. The complexity is linear to the number of pixels and disparity range, which results in a runtime of just 1-2s on typical test images. An in depth evaluation of the Mutual Information based matching cost demonstrates a tolerance against a wide range of radiometric transformations. Finally, examples of reconstructions from huge aerial frame and pushbroom images demonstrate that the presented ideas are working well on practical problems. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

Using this taxonomy, we compare existing stereo methods and present experiments evaluating the performance of many different variants.

abstract = {This paper describes a new architecture and the corresponding implementation of a stereo vision system that covers the entire stereo vision process including noise reduction, rectification, disparity estimation, and visualization. Dense disparity estimation is performed using the non-parametric rank transform and semi-global matching (SGM), which is among the top performing stereo matching methods and outperforms locally-based methods in terms of quality of disparity maps and robustness under difficult imaging conditions. Stream-based processing of the SGM despite its non-scan-aligned, complex data dependencies is achieved by a scalable, systolic-array-based architecture. This architecture fulfills the demands of real-world applications regarding frame rate, depth resolution and low resource usage. The architecture is based on a novel two-dimensional parallelization concept for the SGM. An FPGA implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-5 generates disparity maps of VGA images (640x480 pixel) with a 128 pixel disparity range under real-time conditions (30 fps) at a clock frequency as low as 39 MHz. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

Compared to previous works, our approach does not use deep learning of pixel appearance descriptors, employing very fast classical matching scores instead. At the same time, our approach uses a deep convolutional network to predict the local parameters of cost volume aggregation process, which in this paper we implement using differentiable domain transform. By treating such transform as a recurrent neural network, we are able to train our whole system that includes cost volume computation, cost-volume aggregation (smoothing), and winner-takes-all disparity selection end-to-end. The resulting method is highly efficient at test time, while achieving good matching accuracy. On the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 benchmark, it achieves a result of 5.08{\%} and 6.34{\%} error rate respectively while running at 29 frames per second rate on a modern GPU.},

This topic has been thoroughly investigated by Hu and Mordohai in 2010 (and 2012) considering 17 confidence measures and two local algorithms on the two datasets available at that time. However, since then major breakthroughs happened in this field: the availability of much larger and challenging datasets, novel and more effective stereo algorithms including ones based on deep learning and confidence measures leveraging on machine learning techniques. Therefore, this paper aims at providing an exhaustive and updated review and quantitative evaluation of 52 (actually, 76 considering variants) stateof- the-art confidence measures - focusing on recent ones mostly based on random-forests and deep learning - with three algorithms on the challenging datasets available today. Moreover we deal with problems inherently induced by learning-based confidence measures. How are these methods able to generalize to new data? How a specific training improves their effectiveness? How more effective confidence measures can actually improve the overall stereo accurac?},

@article{Einecke2013,
abstract = {Accurate stereoscopic depth estimation, in particular of the road surface area, is one of several key technologies to improve Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). One major problem is that the quality of the stereoscopic depth measurements of the road is often poor - which is mainly attributed to a lack of texture on the road surface. Especially for patch-matching stereo algorithms, the estimated depths look irregular and bumpy. In this paper, we show that the violation of the fronto-parallel assumption is the major reason for a bad depth estimation and not a low-contrast texture on the road surface. Since patch-matching or block-matching stereo inherently assumes a constant disparity within one patch, this is violated if the cameras are oriented almost parallel to the ground, which is typically the case in ADAS, and which leads to a strong distortion of the appearance between the two cameras. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a compensation of this distortion by applying a linear warp on one of the stereo images according to the expected disparity for the planar ground. This recovers the fronto-parallel assumption and results in a very good depth estimations of road surfaces. Our experiments on the KITTI stereo benchmark demonstrate the quantitative competitiveness of the approach, while retaining the speed and simplicity of block-matching stereo approaches. Furthermore, our experiments show that the approach is very robust, achieving results for the road surface that are significantly better than standard patch-matching stereo processing without warping for a wide range of warp parameter settings. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The Semi Global Matching (SGM) algorithm is a robust and practical algorithm for dense image matching. The connection between SGM and Belief Propagation was recently developed, and based on that improvements such as correction of over-counting the data term, and a new confidence measure have been proposed. Later the MGM algorithm has been proposed, it aims at improving the regularization step of SGM, but has only been evaluated on the Middlebury stereo benchmark so far. This paper evaluates these proposed improvements on the ISPRS satellite stereo benchmark, using a Pleiades Triplet and a Cartosat-1 Stereo pair. The over-counting correction slightly improves matching density, at the expense of adding a few outliers. The MGM cost aggregation shows leads to a slight increase of accuracy.},

SGM is a widely used regularization method for real scenes because of its high accuracy and fast computation speed. Even though SGM can obtain accurate results, tuning of SGM's penalty-parameters, which control a smoothness and discontinuity of a disparity map, is uneasy and empirical methods have been proposed. We propose a learning based penalties estimation method, which we call SGM-Nets that consist of Convolutional Neural Networks. A small image patch and its position are input into SGM-Nets to predict the penalties for the 3D object structures. In order to train the networks, we introduce a novel loss function which is able to use sparsely annotated disparity maps such as captured by a LiDAR sensor in real environments. Moreover, we propose a novel SGM parameterization, which deploys different penalties depending on either positive or negative disparity changes in order to represent the object structures more discriminatively.

In 2nd channel, a disparity from another image is considered such that the matches from left to right image should be consistent with those from right to left. The disparity patches are used as inputs of Convolutional Neural Networks so that the features and classifiers are simultaneously trained unlike what is done by existing methods.

Non-parametric local transforms rely on the relative ordering of local intensity values, and not on the intensity values themselves. Correlation using such transforms can tolerate a significant number of outliers. This can result in improved performance near object boundaries when compared with conventional methods such as normalized correlation. We introduce two non-parametric local transforms: the rank transform, which measures local intensity, and the census transform, which summarizes local image structure. We describe some properties of these transforms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real data.},

abstract = {We propose an area-based local stereo matching algorithm for accurate disparity estimation across all image regions. A well-known challenge to local stereo methods is to decide an appropriate support window for the pixel under consideration, adapting the window shape or the pixelwise support weight to the underlying scene structures. Our stereo method tackles this problem with two key contributions. First, for each anchor pixel an upright cross local support skeleton is adaptively constructed, with four varying arm lengths decided on color similarity and connectivity constraints. Second, given the local cross-decision results, we dynamically construct a shape-adaptive full support region on the fly, merging horizontal segments of the crosses in the vertical neighborhood. Approximating image structures accurately, the proposed method is among the best performing local stereo methods according to the benchmark Middlebury stereo evaluation. Additionally, it reduces memory consumption significantly thanks to our compact local cross representation. To accelerate matching cost aggregation performed in an arbitrarily shaped 2-D region, we also propose an orthogonal integral image technique, yielding a speedup factor of 5-15 over the straightforward integration. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

This is mainly due to easy implementation and handling but also to the linear computational complexity, as compared to more elaborated algorithms based on diffusion processes, graph-cut or bilateral filtering. In this paper, we introduce a new two-stage matching cost for the traditional approach: the summed normalized cross-correlation (SNCC). This new cost function performs a normalized cross-correlation in the first stage and aggregates the correlation values in a second stage. We show that this new measure can be implemented efficiently and that it leads to a substantial improvement of the performance of the traditional stereo approach because it is less sensitive to high contrast outliers. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Sub-pixel estimation using parabola fitting over three points with their similarity measures is also a common method to increase the resolution of matching. However, this estimation contains a systematic error depending on the image characteristics, the similarity function, and the fitting function used for the sub-pixel estimation. In this paper, the characteristics of sub-pixel estimation error have been clarified using a simple analysis model. Although this model is quite simple, it enables us to make a theoretical analysis for general images without assuming any specific image pattern. Through this analysis, it has been shown that there are the right combinations of the similarity functions and the fitting functions. Also, so-called "pixel-locking" effect, where the estimated positions tend to be biased toward integer values, has been explained. Finally, the analyses are verified with an experiment using real images.},

Inference algorithms based on graph cuts and belief propagation have been found to yield accurate results but despite recent advances are often too slow for practical use. In this paper we present some algorithmic techniques that substantially improve the running time of the loopy belief propagation approach. One of the techniques reduces the complexity of the inference algorithm to be linear rather than quadratic in the number of possible labels for each pixel which is important for problems such as image restoration that have a large label set. Another technique speeds up and reduces the memory requirements of belief propagation on grid graphs. A third technique is a multi-grid method that makes it possible to obtain good results with a small fixed number of message passing iterations independent of the size of the input images. Taken together these techniques speed up the standard algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In practice we obtain results that are as accurate as those of other global methods (e.g. using the Middlebury stereo benchmark) while being nearly as fast as purely local methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {This paper considers the use of stereo vision in structured environments. Sharp discontinuities and large untextured areas must be anticipated, but complex or natural shapes of objects and fine structures should be handled as well. Additionally, radiometric differences of input images often occur in practice. Finally, computation time is an issue for handling large or many images in acceptable time. The Semi-Global Matching method is chosen as it fulfills already many of the requirements. Remaining problems in structured environments are carefully analyzed and two novel extensions suggested. Firstly, intensity consistent disparity selection is proposed for handling untextured areas. Secondly, discontinuity preserving interpolation is suggested for filling holes in the disparity images that are caused by some filters. It is shown that the performance of the new method on test images with ground truth is comparable to the currently best stereo methods, but the complexity and runtime is much lower. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

@article{Poggi2019,
abstract = {Stereo is a prominent technique to infer dense depth maps from images, and deep learning further pushed forward the state-of-the-art, making end-to-end architectures unrivaled when enough data is available for training. However, deep networks suffer from significant drops in accuracy when dealing with new environments. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Guided Stereo Matching, a novel paradigm leveraging a small amount of sparse, yet reliable depth measurements retrieved from an external source enabling to ameliorate this weakness. The additional sparse cues required by our method can be obtained with any strategy (e.g., a LiDAR) and used to enhance features linked to corresponding disparity hypotheses. Our formulation is general and fully differentiable, thus enabling to exploit the additional sparse inputs in pre-trained deep stereo networks as well as for training a new instance from scratch. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets and two state-of-the-art deep architectures show that even with a small set of sparse input cues, i) the proposed paradigm enables significant improvements to pre-trained networks. Moreover, ii) training from scratch notably increases accuracy and robustness to domain shifts. Finally, iii) it is suited and effective even with traditional stereo algorithms such as SGM.},

abstract = {The census transform in computing the matching cost of stereo matching is simple and robust under luminance variations in stereo image pairs; however, different disparity maps are generated depending on the shape and size of the census transform window. In this paper, we propose a stereo matching method with variable sizes of census transform windows based on the gradients of stereo images. Our experiment shows higher accuracy of disparity values in the area of depth discontinuities.},

@article{Hermann2013,
abstract = {Semi-global matching (SGM) is a technique of choice for dense stereo estimation in current industrial driver-assistance systems due to its real-time processing capability and its convincing performance. In this paper we introduce iSGM as a new cost integration concept for semi-global matching. In iSGM, accumulated costs are iteratively evaluated and intermediate disparity results serve as input to generate semi-global distance maps. This novel data structure supports fast analysis of spatial disparity information and allows for reliable search space reduction in consecutive cost accumulation. As a consequence horizontal costs are stabilized which improves the robustness of the matching result. We demonstrate the superiority of this iterative integration concept against a standard configuration of semi-global matching and compare our results to current state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Tonioni2020,
abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks trained end-to-end are the state-of-the-art methods to regress dense disparity maps from stereo pairs. These models, however, suffer from a notable decrease in accuracy when exposed to scenarios significantly different from the training set, e.g., real vs synthetic images, etc.). We argue that it is extremely unlikely to gather enough samples to achieve effective training/tuning in any target domain, thus making this setup impractical for many applications. Instead, we propose to perform unsupervised and continuous online adaptation of a deep stereo network, which allows for preserving its accuracy in any environment. However, this strategy is extremely computationally demanding and thus prevents real-time inference. We address this issue introducing a new lightweight, yet effective, deep stereo architecture, Modularly ADaptive Network (MADNet) and developing a Modular ADaptation (MAD) algorithm, which independently trains sub-portions of the network. By deploying MADNet together with MAD we introduce the first real-time self-adaptive deep stereo system enabling competitive performance on heterogeneous datasets.},

abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},

@article{Demetz2013,
abstract = {Most researchers agree that invariances are desirable in computer vision systems. However, one always has to keep in mind that this is at the expense of accuracy: By construction, all invariances inevitably discard information. The concept of morphological invariance is a good example for this trade-off and will be in the focus of this paper. Our goal is to develop a descriptor of local image structure that carries the maximally possible amount of local image information under this invariance. To fulfill this requirement, our descriptor has to encode the full ordering of the pixel intensities in the local neighbourhood. As a solution, we introduce the complete rank transform, which stores the intensity rank of every pixel in the local patch. As a proof of concept, we embed our novel descriptor in a prototypical TVL1-type energy functional for optical flow computation, which we minimise with a traditional coarse-to-fine warping scheme. In this straightforward framework, we demonstrate that our descriptor is preferable over related features that exhibit the same invariance. Finally, we show by means of public benchmark systems that our method produces - in spite of its simplicity - results of competitive quality.},

The paper concludes with the fact that though methods like NCC and ZNCC offer higher accuracy but they are computationally heavy for embedding into real time systems. SAD and SSD are suitable choice for embedded systems. However applications requiring higher accuracy should use correlation based method.},
