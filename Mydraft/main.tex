% Compilation instructions: 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use pdflatex to compile! Input images are expected as PDF files.
% Example compilation:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You need to run pdflatex multiple times so that all the cross-references
% are fixed. pdflatex will tell you if you need to re-run it (a warning
% will be issued)  
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Compilation has been tested to work in ukk.cs.hut.fi and kosh.hut.fi
% - if you have problems of missing .sty -files, then the local LaTeX
% environment does not have all the required packages installed.
% For example, when compiling in vipunen.hut.fi, you get an error that
% tikz.sty is missing - in this case you must either compile somewhere
% else, or you cannot use TikZ graphics in your thesis and must therefore
% remove or comment out the tikz package and all the tikz definitions.

% The input files (tex files) are encoded with the latin-1 encoding

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% OT1 font encoding seems to work better than T1. Check the rendered
% PDF file to see if the fonts are encoded properly as vectors (instead
% of rendered bitmaps). You can do this by zooming very close to any letter

% Supervisors and instructors
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Usually thesis have one supervisor and one advisor. Sometimes you
% may have two advisors and, in double degree
% programs, you may have two supervisors. 
% If you have two supervisors, write both names here, separate them with a

% Also remember to add the package option ``twosupervisors'' or
% ``twoinstructors'' to the aalto-thesis package (aalto-thesis.sty
% file line 72), so that the titles are in plural.

% Example of twosupervisors:
\newcommand{\SUPERVISOR}{Professor Juho Kannala\\
  Professor Daniele Fontanelli\\
  Professor Nicola Conci}

% If you have only one instructor, just write one name here
\newcommand{\INSTRUCTOR}{Sami Ruuskanen M.Sc. (Tech.)}

% If you have two supervisors, it is common to write the schools
% of the supervisors in the cover page. If the following command is defined,
% then the supervisor names shown here are printed in the cover page. Otherwise,
% the supervisor names defined above are used.
\newcommand{\COVERSUPERVISOR}{Professor Juho Kannala, Aalto University\\
  Professor Daniele Fontanelli, University of Trento\\
  Professor Nicola Conci, University of Trento}

% The same option is for the instructors, if you have multiple instructors.
% \newcommand{\COVERINSTRUCTOR}{Oili Ohjaaja M.Sc. (Tech.), Aalto University\\

% Layout settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% When you write in English, you should use the standard LaTeX 
% paragraph formatting: paragraphs are indented, and there is no 
% space between paragraphs.

% If you write your thesis Finnish, uncomment these lines; if 
% you write in English, leave these lines commented! 
% \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
% \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

% Use this to control how much space there is between each line of text.
% 1 is normal (no extra space), 1.3 is about one-half more space, and
% 1.6 is about double line spacing.  
% \linespread{1} % This is the default
% \linespread{1.3}

% Bibliography style
% acm style gives you a basic reference style. It works only with numbered
% references.
\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}
% Plainnat is a plain style that works with both numbered and name citations.
% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}


% Extra hyphenation settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can list here all the files that are not hyphenated correctly.
% You can provide many \hyphenation commands and/or separate each word
% with a space inside a single command. Put hyphens in the places where
% a word can be hyphenated.
% Note that (by default) LaTeX will not hyphenate words that already
% have a hyphen in them (for example, if you write ``structure-modification 
% operation'', the word structure-modification will never be hyphenated).
% You need a special package to hyphenate those words.
% \hyphenation{di-gi-taa-li-sta yksi-suun-tai-sta}



% The preamble ends here, and the document begins. 
% Place all formatting commands and such before this line.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{document}
% This command adds a PDF bookmark to the cover page. You may leave
% it out if you don't like it...
\pdfbookmark[0]{Cover page}{bookmark.0.cover}
% This command is defined in aalto-thesis.sty. It controls the page

% Cover page
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Options: finnish, english, and swedish
% These control in which language the cover-page information is shown

% Abstracts
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Include an abstract in the language that the thesis is written in,
% and if your native language is Finnish or Swedish, one in that language.

% Abstract in English

\thesisabstract{english}{
In this Master's thesis project a novel implementation of a stereo matching based method is proposed.
Moreover, an exhaustive analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms in that field is outlined.
Specifically, both standard and deep learning based methods have been extensively investigated, thus to provide useful insights for the designed implementation.
Regarding the developed work, it is basically structured in the following manner.\\
At first a research phase has been carried out, hence to simply and rapidly test the thought strategy.
Subsequently, a first implementation of the algorithm has been designed and tested using data available from the Middlebury 2014 dataset, which is one of the most exploited dataset in the computer vision area.
At this stage, numerous tests have been completed and consequently various changes to the algorithm pipeline have been made, in order to improve the final result.\\
Finally, after that exhaustive researching phase the actual method has been designed and tested using real environment images obtained from the stereo device developed by the company, in which this work has been produced.\\
Fundamental element of the project is indeed that stereo device.
As a matter of fact, the designed algorithm in based on the data produced by the cameras that constitute it.
Specifically, the main function of the system designed by LaDiMo is to make the built stereo matching based procedure simultaneously faster and accurate.
As a matter of fact, one of the main prerogative of the project was to create an algorithm that has to prove potential real time results.\\
This has been, in fact, achieved by applying one of the two methods created.
Specifically, it is a lightweight implementation, which strongly exploits the information coming from the LaDiMo device, thus to provide accurate results, keeping the computational time small.\\
At the end of this Master's thesis images showing the main outcomes obtained are proposed.
Moreover, a discussion regarding the further improvements that are going to be add to the project is carried out.
In fact, the method implemented, being not optimized only demonstrate a potential real time implementation, which can be actually achieved through an efficient refactoring of the main pipeline.
