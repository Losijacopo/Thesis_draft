% Compilation instructions: 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use pdflatex to compile! Input images are expected as PDF files.
% Example compilation:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You need to run pdflatex multiple times so that all the cross-references
% are fixed. pdflatex will tell you if you need to re-run it (a warning
% will be issued)  
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Compilation has been tested to work in ukk.cs.hut.fi and kosh.hut.fi
% - if you have problems of missing .sty -files, then the local LaTeX
% environment does not have all the required packages installed.
% For example, when compiling in vipunen.hut.fi, you get an error that
% tikz.sty is missing - in this case you must either compile somewhere
% else, or you cannot use TikZ graphics in your thesis and must therefore
% remove or comment out the tikz package and all the tikz definitions. 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,oneside,pdftex]{report}
% The input files (tex files) are encoded with the latin-1 encoding 
% (ISO-8859-1 works). Change the latin1-option if you use UTF8 
% (at some point LaTeX did not work with UTF8, but I'm not sure
% what the current situation is) 
%\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% OT1 font encoding seems to work better than T1. Check the rendered
% PDF file to see if the fonts are encoded properly as vectors (instead
% of rendered bitmaps). You can do this by zooming very close to any letter 
% - if the letter is shown pixelated, you should change this setting 
% (try commenting out the entire line, for example).  
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[english]{babel}

% Natbib allows you to select the format of the bibliography references.
% The first example uses numbered citations: 
\usepackage[square,sort&compress,numbers]{natbib}
% The second example uses author-year citations.
% If you use author-year citations, change the bibliography style (below); 
% acm style does not work with author-year citations.
% Also, you should use \citet (cite in text) when you wish to refer
% to the author directly (\citet{blaablaa} said blaa blaa), and 
% \citep when you wish to refer similarly than with numbered citations
% (It has been said that blaa blaa~\citep{blaablaa}).

% Hyperref
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Hyperref creates links from URLs, for references, and creates a
% TOC in the PDF file.
% This package must be the last one you include, because it has
% compatibility issues with many other packages and it fixes
% those issues when it is loaded.   
%\RequirePackage[pdftex]{hyperref}
\RequirePackage[pdfa]{hyperref}
% Setup hyperref so that links are clickable but do not look 
% different
\hypersetup{colorlinks=false,raiselinks=false,breaklinks=true}
\hypersetup{pdfborder={0 0 0}}
\hypersetup{bookmarksnumbered=true}
% The following line suggests the PDF reader that it should show the 
% first level of bookmarks opened in the hierarchical bookmark view. 
\hypersetup{bookmarksopen=true,bookmarksopenlevel=1}
% Hyperref can also set up the PDF metadata fields. These are
% set a bit later on, after the thesis setup.   

% Thesis setup
% ==================================================================
% Change these to fit your own thesis.
% \COMMAND always refers to the English version;
% \FCOMMAND refers to the Finnish version; and
% \SCOMMAND refers to the Swedish version.
% You may comment/remove those language variants that you do not use
% (but then you must not include the abstracts for that language)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you do not find the command for a text that is shown in the cover page or
% in the abstract texts, check the aalto-thesis.sty file and locate the text
% from there. 
% All the texts are configured in language-specific blocks (lots of commands
% that look like this: \renewcommand{\ATCITY}{Espoo}.
% You can just fix the texts there. Just remember to check all the language
% variants you use (they are all there in the same place). 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\TITLE}{Structured light assisted real time stereo photogrammetry for robotics and automation} 
\newcommand{\SUBTITLE}{Novel implementation of stereo matching}
\newcommand{\DATE}{\date}

% Supervisors and instructors
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Usually thesis have one supervisor and one advisor. Sometimes you
% may have two advisors and, in double degree
% programs, you may have two supervisors. 
% If you have two supervisors, write both names here, separate them with a 
% double-backslash (see below for an example)
% Also remember to add the package option ``twosupervisors'' or
% ``twoinstructors'' to the aalto-thesis package (aalto-thesis.sty
% file line 72), so that the titles are in plural.

% Example of twosupervisors:
\newcommand{\SUPERVISOR}{Professor Juho Kannala\\
  Professor Nicola Conci}

% If you have only one instructor, just write one name here
\newcommand{\INSTRUCTOR}{Sami Ruuskanen M.Sc. (Tech.)}

% If you have two supervisors, it is common to write the schools
% of the supervisors in the cover page. If the following command is defined,
% then the supervisor names shown here are printed in the cover page. Otherwise,
% the supervisor names defined above are used.
\newcommand{\COVERSUPERVISOR}{Professor Juho Kannala, Aalto University\\
  Professor Nicola Conci, University of Trento}

% The same option is for the instructors, if you have multiple instructors.
% \newcommand{\COVERINSTRUCTOR}{Oili Ohjaaja M.Sc. (Tech.), Aalto University\\
%  Elli Opas M.Sc. (Tech), Aalto SCI}


% Other stuff
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\PROFESSORSHIP}{Autonomous Systems}
% Professorship code is the same in all languages
\newcommand{\PROFCODE}{}
\newcommand{\KEYWORDS}{stereo vision; matching cost; census transform; hamming distance; binary pattern; semi-global matching}
\newcommand{\LANGUAGE}{English}

% Author is the same for all languages
\newcommand{\AUTHOR}{Jacopo Losi}


% Currently the English versions are used for the PDF file metadata
% Set the PDF title
\hypersetup{pdftitle={\TITLE\ \SUBTITLE}}
% Set the PDF author
\hypersetup{pdfauthor={\AUTHOR}}
% Set the PDF keywords
\hypersetup{pdfkeywords={\KEYWORDS}}
% Set the PDF subject
\hypersetup{pdfsubject={Master's Thesis}}


% Layout settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% When you write in English, you should use the standard LaTeX 
% paragraph formatting: paragraphs are indented, and there is no 
% space between paragraphs.

% If you write your thesis Finnish, uncomment these lines; if 
% you write in English, leave these lines commented! 
% \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
% \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

% Use this to control how much space there is between each line of text.
% 1 is normal (no extra space), 1.3 is about one-half more space, and
% 1.6 is about double line spacing.  
% \linespread{1} % This is the default
% \linespread{1.3}

% Bibliography style
% acm style gives you a basic reference style. It works only with numbered
% references.
\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}
% Plainnat is a plain style that works with both numbered and name citations.
% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}


% Extra hyphenation settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can list here all the files that are not hyphenated correctly.
% You can provide many \hyphenation commands and/or separate each word
% with a space inside a single command. Put hyphens in the places where
% a word can be hyphenated.
% Note that (by default) LaTeX will not hyphenate words that already
% have a hyphen in them (for example, if you write ``structure-modification 
% operation'', the word structure-modification will never be hyphenated).
% You need a special package to hyphenate those words.
% \hyphenation{di-gi-taa-li-sta yksi-suun-tai-sta}



% The preamble ends here, and the document begins. 
% Place all formatting commands and such before this line.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{document}
% This command adds a PDF bookmark to the cover page. You may leave
% it out if you don't like it...
\pdfbookmark[0]{Cover page}{bookmark.0.cover}
% This command is defined in aalto-thesis.sty. It controls the page 
% numbering based on whether the doublenumbering option is specified
\startcoverpage

% Cover page
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Options: finnish, english, and swedish
% These control in which language the cover-page information is shown
\coverpage{english}


% Abstracts
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Include an abstract in the language that the thesis is written in,
% and if your native language is Finnish or Swedish, one in that language.

% Abstract in English
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\thesisabstract{english}{
The abstract provides goal, motivation, background, and conclusions of
the work. It has to fit to one page together with the bibliographical
information. 

If the thesis is in English and the language of school
education is Finnish or Swedish, the abstract is written in English
and in Finnish or in Swedish. If the language of school education is
other than Finnish or Swedish, the abstract is written in English only.

The thesis example file (\texttt{thesis-example.tex}), all the chapter content
files (\texttt{1introduction.tex} and so on), and the Aalto style file
(\texttt{aalto-thesis.sty}) are commented with explanations on how the Aalto
thesis works. The files also contain some examples on how to customize various
details of the thesis layout, and of course the example text works as an
example in itself. Please read the comments and the example text; that should
get you well on your way!

In the thesis template, you can find the text of the abstract in the
abstract in the \texttt{thesis-example.tex}
file, together with the bibliographical information of the abstract tables.
\fixme{This is an example how to use fixme: add your abstract here.} 
Fixme is a command that helps you identify parts of your thesis that still
require some work. When compiled in the custom \texttt{mydraft} mode, text
parts tagged with fixmes are shown in bold and with fixme tags around them. When
compiled in normal mode, the fixme-tagged text is shown normally (without
special formatting). The draft mode also causes the ``Draft'' text to appear on
the front page, alongside with the document compilation date. The custom
\texttt{mydraft} mode is selected by the \texttt{mydraft} option given for the
package \texttt{aalto-thesis}, near the top of the \texttt{thesis-example.tex}
file.

% Table of contents
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\cleardoublepage
% This command adds a PDF bookmark that links to the contents.
